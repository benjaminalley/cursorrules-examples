# Cursor Rules Repository

## Overview
Welcome to the **Cursor Rules** repository! This project is a collection of `.cursorrules` files, categorized by different technologies, as well as a generic set of rules that cover fundamental best practices in programming.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```
/cursor-rules/
│-- generic/.cursorrules   # General best practices applicable to all programming
│-- vue3/.cursorrules       # Rules specifically for Vue 3 projects
│-- react/.cursorrules      # Rules specifically for React projects
│-- node/.cursorrules       # Rules specifically for Node.js projects
│-- python/.cursorrules     # Rules specifically for Python projects
│-- ...                     # More technology-specific folders
```

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to maintain a centralized location for `.cursorrules` files that enforce best practices and coding standards across different technologies. These rules help ensure:

- **Code Consistency** – Maintain a uniform coding style across projects.
- **Best Practices** – Encourage adherence to widely accepted programming principles.
- **Efficiency** – Reduce technical debt and improve code maintainability.
